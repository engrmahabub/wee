** Advanced formula.**

```
n = 3
    ₙ
y = ∑(x)
    ¹
=> y = 1+2+3 = 6    
```    

**Average**
```  
X = [1,2,3]  
n = 3

    ∑(X)
a = ————
     n    
```

Using hooks and extension bar:
```
    ⎡1 1 1⎤   
A = ⎢—,—,—⎥   
    ⎣2 4 8⎦   
```

**Matrix*
```
    ⎡e₁₁,e₂₁⎤   
A = ⎢e₁₂,e₂₂⎥   
    ⎣e₁₃,e₂₃⎦   
```

Function call with formula:
```    
     ⎛ 1 + x ⎞³
x =  ⎜———————⎟   
     ⎝ x²+y² ⎠   
```
Power expression:
```
    ⎧  1+x  ⎫²   
x = ⎨———————⎬   
    ⎩ x²+y³ ⎭    
```
Large integrale:
```
    ⌠ⁿ         
y = ⎮(a+b+x)ₓ  
    ⌡₀          
```
**Line solidus**
Large sigma sum can't be supported. (large solidus is missing)
That is all I can do for now:

```

╲
╱
‾‾‾
```
